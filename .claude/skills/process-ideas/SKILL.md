# Process Ideas Skill

## Prerequisites
- Read SYSTEM/_ai/Agents/README.md for universe context
- Read SYSTEM/_ai/Agents/MISSION_PROTOCOLS.md for detailed workflow
- Read SYSTEM/_ai/Agents/UNIVERSE_STRUCTURE.md for INBOX routing rules

## Workflow

1. **Scan Daily Stars**
   - Look in daily notes (YYYY-MM-DD format) from the last 7 days
   - Search for lines starting with `- [i]` (idea signals)
   - Search "What's On My Mind?" sections for task/idea mentions

2. **Present Ideas**
   - Show each idea with context (date, time, surrounding text)
   - Format: "📅 YYYY-MM-DD @ HH:MM [pm/am] (idea signal/captured idea)"

3. **Process Each Idea**
   For each idea found, ask:
   - Convert to mission? (y/n/later)
   - Which sub-INBOX? (auto-suggest based on context and tag routing rules from MISSION_PROTOCOLS.md)
   - Tag (infer from context when possible)
   - Due date (optional, YYYY-MM-DD format)
   - Priority (optional: ⏫ critical / 🔼 high / 🔽 low)

4. **Format Mission**
   Use Tasks plugin format:
   ```
   - [ ] mission description #tag 📅 YYYY-MM-DD ⏫
   ```

5. **Add to Sub-INBOX**
   - Route to appropriate INBOX/XX_NAME sub-INBOX file
   - Add to relevant section within that file
   - Confirm addition to user

## Tag Routing Rules
Reference MISSION_PROTOCOLS.md for complete routing map:
- #obsidian → 08_UNIVERSE
- #chores → 02_CHORES
- #personal, #reading, #scripting, #gaming, #gospel, #personal/* → 01_PERSONAL
- #finances, #finances/* → 03_FINANCES
- #writing, #writing/*, #5th-of-june, #5oJ, #5thofjune → 04_WRITING
- #coloringthecosmos, #coloring-the-cosmos, #coloring, #coloring/*, #coloringbooks, #coloringbooks/* → 05_COLORING
- #family, #family/*, #friends, #friends/* → 06_FAMILY-FRIENDS
- #work → ask user
- unknown → prompt user, offer to remember routing

## Notes
- Always check both [i] glyphs AND "What's On My Mind?" sections
- Remove "every Monday" type frequency text when converting recurring task templates
- Be respectful of Andrea's reactive workflow - suggest, don't dictate
- If unsure about routing, ask rather than guess
- Keep mission descriptions concise and actionable
