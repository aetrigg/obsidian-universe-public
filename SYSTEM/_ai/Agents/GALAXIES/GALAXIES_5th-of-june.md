# 5th of June Galaxy

**Status:** Active  
**Dedicated Nebula:** Yes (5th of June folder)  
**Primary Focus:** Boy band novel series (10-year creative writing project)

---

## 🌌 Overview

The 5th of June galaxy is Andrea's standalone novel series about a fictional boy band - a creative writing project she originally developed in 2015, shelved in 2016, and returned to in 2025 after a 10-year gap.

Due to this decade-long hiatus, Andrea is actively updating the series to reflect modern contexts, moving the timeline from the 2010s to the 2020s and incorporating contemporary fandom culture, social media dynamics, and current music industry realities.

This galaxy represents Andrea's deep creative investment in character-driven romance storytelling centered around the lives, careers, and relationships of five band members who have reached "American One Direction" levels of fame.

## 📖 The Series

### Core Concept & Setting
The series is a contemporary romance saga centered on **5th of June (5oJ)**, a fictional boy band from Austin, Texas, that has reached "American One Direction" levels of fame by 2025.

**Origin Story:**  
The band formed in high school as an acoustic pop-punk group. They gained initial notoriety after reaching the Top 48 on America's Got Talent in 2020 via online audition, where they were eliminated for lacking versatility. This failure prompted a pivot to a polished, vocal-heavy pop sound managed by their "sixth member," Ted Dalton.

**The "Junies":**  
The series heavily integrates modern fandom culture. The fans, known as "Junies," have created extensive lore (such as the theory that the band is named after a Battle of the Bands date), and their social media activity often drives the plot.

### Narrative Structure

**The Framing Device:**  
The series utilizes a retrospective framing device similar to *How I Met Your Mother*. The stories are set in or around 2025 (often during an interview), where each member recounts the specific story of how they met their significant other.

**POV:**  
Each book focuses on a different couple, alternating points of view between the band member and his love interest.

## 📚 Story Summaries (Chronological Release Order)

### Book 1: The Shy One (Jordan & Mac)
Set during the Wild Nights tour in 2023. Jordan meets Mac through her best friend after a concert. Their relationship begins over text and evolves when Mac joins the tour to ghostwrite the band's behind-the-scenes book. The plot focuses on their shared trauma regarding adoption and the challenges of navigating tour life while managing Mac's epilepsy. The climax involves a grand gesture in a sunflower field.

### Book 2: The Responsible One (Nolan & Tiffany)
An enemies-to-lovers story set around 2024. It begins when Tiffany posts a viral TikTok calling Nolan rude. The resulting PR nightmare forces them into proximity, where they realize their public feud masks a genuine connection.

### Book 3: The Heartthrob (Eli & Laura)
Set earlier in the timeline during the Summer Rain tour (2022). Eli sings the song "For Laura" during a concert and asks if anyone named Laura is in the audience. He spots Laura Collins, and later runs into her by chance at a diner, sparking a fairytale "fan-meets-idol" romance.

### Book 4: The Bad Boy (Beck & Autumn)
Set during the band's more mature, darker era (approx. 2025/2026). Beck is spiraling into drug use and burnout. Autumn, who taught him piano when they were kids, re-enters his life after hearing a song he wrote about her. This is a second-chance romance focused on redemption and healing.

### Book 5: The Cute One (Aiden & Delilah)
Set during the peak of the band's global fame. Aiden enters a secret relationship with pop superstar Delilah James. The conflict revolves around two massive celebrities trying to maintain a private love life while under constant media scrutiny.
