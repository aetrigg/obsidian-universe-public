# Obsidian Galaxy

**Status:** Active (highest current focus)  
**Dedicated Nebula:** No (meta-galaxy about the universe itself)  
**Primary Focus:** Learning about and developing "The Universe of Andrea"

---

## 🌌 Overview

The Obsidian galaxy is Andrea's meta-galaxy dedicated to learning about Obsidian, developing the universe structure, and optimizing her cosmic personal knowledge management system. Unlike other galaxies that have dedicated folders, this galaxy is about organizing the universe as a whole, so its notes are distributed across SYSTEM, MUSINGS, and other organizational areas.

This is currently Andrea's most active galaxy - the one she spends the most time in as she builds and refines the infrastructure that supports all other galaxies.

## 🎯 Focus Areas

### Learning Obsidian
- Plugin discovery and experimentation
- Community best practices and workflows
- CSS customization and theming
- Datacore and React component development
- Performance optimization techniques
- Mobile access solutions

### Universe Development
- Cosmic terminology and metaphor refinement
- Vault structure organization
- Template creation and automation
- Dashboard and observatory design
- Graph view optimization
- Navigation improvements

### System Optimization
- Performance tuning (Dataview → Datacore migration)
- Query optimization
- Automation with Templater scripts
- Plugin evaluation and integration
- Workflow streamlining

## 🗂️ Mission Management

Missions related to the Obsidian galaxy are routed through the INBOX system:

**Tag Routing:**
- `#obsidian` → 08_UNIVERSE sub-INBOX

**Common Mission Types:**
- Test new plugins or features
- Build custom React components
- Optimize Datacore queries
- Create/update templates
- Fix broken functionality
- Redesign dashboards or views
- Research Obsidian community solutions
- CSS styling and theme adjustments
- Documentation updates (like these agent files!)

See [[MISSION_PROTOCOLS]] for complete mission management system.

## 🔗 Integration with Other Systems

### Daily Stars
- Ideas and discoveries captured with `[i]` idea signals
- "What's On My Mind?" journal entries often contain universe improvement thoughts
- `/process-ideas` command helps extract development ideas into missions

### Weekly Overview
- Development sessions scheduled in weekly canvas
- Universe improvements tracked alongside other missions
- Often the most time-intensive galaxy in any given week

### SYSTEM Nebula
Much of the Obsidian galaxy's work lives in SYSTEM:
- Templates
- Scripts
- CSS snippets
- Agent documentation (`_ai` folder)
- Configuration files

### MUSINGS Nebula
- Drafts about the universe (like Discord showcase posts)
- Documentation of processes
- Sharing learnings with community

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Aesthetics First
- Beautiful UI enhances engagement and joy
- Cosmic theming throughout 
- Color-coded nodes, tags, & life areas
- Pixel art banners for visual delight
- Custom CSS for polished experience
- Everything should feel intentional and cohesive

### Function Follows Form (But Both Matter)
- Systems must be both beautiful AND functional
- No compromise on visual design
- Performance matters, but not at the expense of aesthetics
- Front-end development background informs all design decisions

### Work WITH Patterns, Not Against Them
- Systems designed for reactive daily execution
- Automation reduces friction for ADHD workflow
- Captures information at the moment without demanding structure
- Organization happens when ready, not forced upfront

---

## 💡 Community Engagement

### Discord Participation
- Active in Obsidian Discord community
- Sharing universe showcase and learnings
- Getting inspiration from other vault structures
- Contributing to discussions about workflows

### Learning Resources
- Community plugins and templates
- Reddit discussions and best practices
- YouTube tutorials and showcases
- Direct collaboration with plugin developers (when needed)

---

## 🚀 Future Development

### Planned Enhancements
- Complete Dataview → Datacore migration
- Optimize 00_MAIN INBOX aggregation
- Enhance mobile access (husband's project)
- Rename daily star headings to cosmic terminology
- Build Level 10 Life integration
- Develop additional monthly overview components
- Create habit tracking observatory
- Build financial tracking observatories

### Exploratory Ideas
- Convert weekly canvas to Datacore dashboard
- Auto-populate holidays and appointments in weekly overview
- Enhanced Claude Code commands for universe management
- Additional React visualization components
- Community skill/plugin contributions

## 🌟 Why This Galaxy Matters

The Obsidian galaxy represents:
- **Foundation for everything else** - All other galaxies depend on this infrastructure
- **Creative technical expression** - Blending development skills with personal organization
- **Continuous improvement** - Always evolving and optimizing
- **Community contribution** - Sharing learnings and inspiring others
- **Personal growth** - Learning new technologies (Datacore, React) while building useful tools

This galaxy is the engine that powers "The Universe of Andrea" - without it, the other galaxies couldn't function as smoothly.

---

## 📊 Time Investment

Currently the most active galaxy by time spent:
- Daily tweaks and improvements
- Weekly major projects or component builds
- Ongoing learning and experimentation
- Documentation and organization

This high investment reflects both the foundational importance and Andrea's genuine enjoyment of building and optimizing her universe.
