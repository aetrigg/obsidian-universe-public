# Galaxies Index

This document provides an overview of all active galaxies (projects/areas of interest) in Andrea's universe, as well as the root nebulae (system folders) that support the entire vault.

## 🌌 What Makes a Galaxy?

**Galaxies** are major projects or areas of interest that Andrea is actively working on. They are distinct from root nebulae (system folders) in that they represent creative work, personal development, or ongoing projects rather than organizational infrastructure.

### Galaxy Formation Requirements
- Must be hyperfixated on the topic for a **minimum of 3 months** before creating a new galaxy
- This prevents galaxy sprawl and ensures galaxies represent sustained interests
- Galaxies can go dormant but aren't deleted - they may become active again

### Galaxy vs. Root Nebula
- **Galaxies** = Projects, creative work, areas of development (e.g., 5th of June, Digital Hobonichi)
- **Root Nebulae** = System folders that support the entire universe (e.g., INBOX, SYSTEM, OBSERVATORIES)

Most galaxies have their own dedicated root nebula (folder) at the vault's root level. The exception is the Obsidian galaxy, which is meta-organizational and doesn't need its own folder.

## 🌟 Active Galaxies

### Digital Hobonichi Galaxy
**Status:** Active  
**Dedicated Nebula:** Yes (Digital Hobonichi folder)  
**Focus:** Daily/weekly/monthly planning and logging system based on analog Hobonichi  

**Description:**  
Andrea's digital recreation of her beloved Hobonichi planner system. Includes daily stars with rapid logging, weekly overviews with task columns, monthly summaries with visualizations, and yearly tracking. This is the galaxy where Andrea lives day-to-day.

**See:** [[GALAXIES_digital-hobonichi]] for detailed documentation

### 5th of June Galaxy
**Status:** Active  
**Dedicated Nebula:** Yes (5th of June folder)  
**Focus:** Boy band novel series (10-year creative writing project)  

**Description:**  
Andrea's standalone novel series about a fictional boy band, featuring characters like Jordan Quinn and Mac Dawson. This galaxy encompasses imported OneNote archives, canon series bible, character development, plot structures, and eventually the novels themselves. Andrea has been working on this project since 2015.

**See:** [[GALAXIES_5th-of-june]] for detailed documentation

### @coloringthecosmos Galaxy
**Status:** Active  
**Dedicated Nebula:** Yes (Coloring the Cosmos folder)  
**Focus:** Instagram/TikTok cozy coloring content account  

**Description:**  
Andrea's social media presence focused on cozy coloring content. Currently contains marker color palettes and tracking for coloring books. Plans to expand to include branding guidelines, content calendars, and marketing processes.

**See:** [[GALAXIES_coloring-the-cosmos]] for detailed documentation

---

### Obsidian Galaxy
**Status:** Active  
**Dedicated Nebula:** No (meta-galaxy about the universe itself)  
**Focus:** Learning about and developing "The Universe of Andrea"  

**Description:**  
This is the meta-galaxy dedicated to Obsidian learning, universe development, and vault optimization. It's where Andrea spends significant time building and refining the cosmic structure itself. Since it's about organizing the universe as a whole, it doesn't have a dedicated folder - related notes are distributed across SYSTEM, MUSINGS, and other organizational areas.

**See:** [[GALAXIES_obsidian]] for detailed documentation

## ☁️ Root Nebulae (System Folders)

Root nebulae provide organizational infrastructure for the entire universe. Unlike galaxies, these are not projects but rather systems that support all work.

### 📥 INBOX Nebula
**Purpose:** Mission (task) staging and organization  
**Key Feature:** 10 sub-INBOXes for categorizing missions by life area/project  

Contains all missions waiting to be executed, organized into:

- **00_MAIN** - Aggregated view showing all open missions from all sub-INBOXes (being optimized with Datacore)
- **01_PERSONAL** - Personal life missions (#personal, #reading, #scripting, #gaming, #gospel, #personal/*)
- **02_CHORES** - Household tasks (#chores)
- **03_FINANCES** - Financial missions and bill-related tasks (#finances, #finances/*)
- **04_WRITING** - Writing projects including 5th of June (#writing, #writing/*, #5th-of-june, #5oJ, #5thofjune)
- **05_COLORING** - Coloring the Cosmos content missions (#coloringthecosmos, #coloring-the-cosmos, #coloring, #coloring/*, #coloringbooks, #coloringbooks/*)
- **06_FAMILY-FRIENDS** - Social and family missions (#family, #family/*, #friends, #friends/*)
- **07_RECURRING** - Templates for recurring missions and scheduled events (work meetings, weekly chores)
- **08_UNIVERSE** - Obsidian development and universe improvement missions (#obsidian)
- **09_UNSORTED** - QuickAdd landing zone for missions that need routing to appropriate sub-INBOXes

See [[MISSION_PROTOCOLS]] for complete mission management system.

---

### ⚙️ SYSTEM Nebula
**Purpose:** Vault infrastructure and utilities  

Contains:
- Templates (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Data files (.bases files, JSON configs like holidays.json)
- Media (banners, images, gifs)
- Scripts (Templater, custom JavaScript)
- CSS Snippets (cosmic theming)
- Launchpads (quick links using .bases card layouts)
- **_ai/** folder (agent documentation, prompts, skills)

This is the "machinery room" of the universe.

---

### ✍️ MUSINGS Nebula
**Purpose:** Drafting content NOT dedicated to 5th of June galaxy  

Contains:
- Discord posts (like vault showcase drafts)
- Blog drafts
- Social media content
- Meta-content about the universe
- Sub-nebula for source notes related to musings

**Note:** Writing specifically for 5th of June goes in that galaxy, not here.

---

### 📚 SOURCES Nebula
**Purpose:** Reference material and research to be sourced later  

Contains:
- Web clippings (via Obsidian Web Clipper)
- Articles, videos, references
- Organized by source origin
- May eventually merge with BOOKMARKS for simplification

---

### 🔖 BOOKMARKS Nebula
**Purpose:** Chrome bookmarks imported via Obsidian Bookmarks plugin  

Contains:
- Direct imports from Google Chrome
- Potential future merge with SOURCES nebula

---

### 🔭 OBSERVATORIES Nebula
**Purpose:** Dashboards and views of data living elsewhere  

Contains:
- Bills & Subscription Tracker (.bases file)
- Frequency Scanner for idea signals (Datacore component)
- Coloring Books Observatory (.bases file)
- Wealth Flux Report (Datacore component)
- Other dashboards providing perspectives on universe data

**Note:** Not all .bases files live here - some live in SYSTEM (like launchpads).

---

### 🕳️ THE BLACK HOLE Nebula
**Purpose:** Archive folder  

Contains:
- Old/inactive stars
- Deleted content
- Things Andrea wants out of sight

**Status:** "Basically a mess" - not heavily organized or maintained.

## 🗺️ Galaxy-to-Nebula Mapping

Most galaxies have corresponding root nebulae:

```
Digital Hobonichi Galaxy → Digital Hobonichi Nebula (folder)
5th of June Galaxy → 5th of June Nebula (folder)
@coloringthecosmos Galaxy → Coloring the Cosmos Nebula (folder)
Obsidian Galaxy → No dedicated nebula (meta-organizational)
```

Missions for each galaxy are staged in corresponding INBOX sub-folders:
- Digital Hobonichi missions → 01_PERSONAL (daily life) or 08_UNIVERSE (system development)
- 5th of June missions → 04_WRITING
- Coloring missions → 05_COLORING
- Obsidian missions → 08_UNIVERSE

---

## 📊 Galaxy Activity Levels

Galaxies ebb and flow based on Andrea's current hyperfixations:

**High Activity (Current Focus):**
- Obsidian Galaxy - actively building and optimizing the universe
- Digital Hobonichi Galaxy - daily/weekly planning is constant

**Moderate Activity:**
- 5th of June Galaxy - ongoing creative project with bursts of activity
- @coloringthecosmos Galaxy - content creation as inspired

**Note:** Activity levels shift naturally. The 3-month rule prevents creating galaxies for fleeting interests.

---

## 🚀 Creating New Galaxies

If Andrea develops a new sustained interest (3+ months), creating a new galaxy involves:

1. Create dedicated root nebula (folder) for the galaxy
2. Add galaxy to this index file
3. Create detailed galaxy documentation in `GALAXIES/[galaxy-name].md`
4. Consider if new INBOX sub-folder needed, or use existing categorization
5. Update tag routing in [[MISSION_PROTOCOLS]] if new constellation needed

---

## 🌟 Nuclear Star Clusters (MOCs)

Each galaxy can contain **Nuclear Star Clusters** - Maps of Content (MOCs) and indexes that serve as dense navigation hubs.

**Implementation:**
- Generated using Folder Overview plugin
- Auto-update as stars are added
- Live at the center of each galaxy's nebula
