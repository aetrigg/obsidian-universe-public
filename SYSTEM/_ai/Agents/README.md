# The Universe of Andrea - Agent Documentation

**Welcome to Andrea's cosmic personal knowledge management system.**

This modular documentation helps AI agents understand the structure, terminology, and systems within "The Universe of Andrea" - an Obsidian vault that uses celestial metaphors to organize knowledge, projects, and daily life.

---

## 📚 Documentation Structure

**Core Systems:**
- [[UNIVERSE_STRUCTURE]] - Cosmic terminology, vault organization, and root nebulae
- [[MISSION_PROTOCOLS]] - Task management system with Claude Code integration
- [[GALAXIES_INDEX]] - Overview of all active galaxies (projects) and their purposes

**Project-Specific (Galaxies):**
- [[GALAXIES_digital-hobonichi]] - Daily/weekly/monthly planning and logging system
- [[GALAXIES_5th-of-june]] - Boy band novel series bible and writing project
- [[GALAXIES_coloring-the-cosmos]] - Instagram/TikTok cozy coloring content
- [[GALAXIES/_obsidian]] - Obsidian learning and universe development

---

## 🌌 Quick Reference

For essential information about the universe:

- **[[NORTH STAR]]** - Andrea's personal README with cosmic terminology glossary, star chart color codes, and constellation (tag) color coding
- **[[SIGNAL GUIDE]]** - Custom checkbox glyphs used for rapid daily logging, tasks, and events

### Key Concepts
- **Missions** = Tasks (what Andrea calls her to-do items)
- **Idea Signals** = Ideas captured with `[i]` glyph in daily stars that need processing into missions
- **Big Bang (Vault Created):** September 3, 2025
- **Development Environment:** Separate dev vault for testing changes

## 🎯 How to Use This Documentation

### For General Questions
Start with [[UNIVERSE_STRUCTURE]] to understand the cosmic metaphors and vault organization.

### For Task Management
Read [[MISSION_PROTOCOLS]] to understand the mission routing system, sub-INBOXes, and Claude Code commands.

### For Daily/Weekly Planning
Refer to [[GALAXIES_digital-hobonichi]] for details on daily stars, weekly overviews, monthly summaries, and the Sunday night routine.

### For Project-Specific Work
Load the relevant galaxy file from the GALAXIES folder for context on that specific project.

---

## 🔧 Development Context

Andrea maintains two universes:
- **Production Universe** - The primary vault where all actual work happens
- **Dev Universe** - A separate testing environment for experimenting with new features, plugins, and structural changes before implementing in production

When working with Andrea, assume you're in the **dev universe** unless she explicitly mentions working in the main/production universe. This allows for safe experimentation without risking her production vault.

---

## 🚀 Common AI Assistant Tasks

### Mission Management
- Capture idea signals (from `[i]` glyphs) and captured ideas (from journal sections) from daily stars
- Route unsorted missions to appropriate sub-INBOXes
- Suggest daily mission distribution
- Help with weekly planning

### Content Organization
- Process web clippings and bookmarks
- Organize research for galaxies (especially 5th of June)
- Maintain MOCs and nuclear star clusters

### System Optimization
- Improve Datacore/Dataview queries for performance
- Develop custom React components for visualizations
- Enhance CSS for cosmic theming

## 📋 Important Notes

- **Communication Style:** Direct and honest. Andrea prefers constructive feedback over excessive praise.
- **Formatting Preferences:** Avoid overwhelming with too many bullet points or headers unless specifically requested.
- **Technical Approach:** Andrea handles front-end development herself but appreciates help with backend logic, complex queries, and optimization.
- **Usage Limits:** Andrea frequently hits Claude usage limits, so she uses Claude Code for vault analysis and Gemini for complex coding tasks when needed.

If this is your first time reading this documentation:

1. Read [[UNIVERSE_STRUCTURE]] to understand the cosmic framework
2. Read [[MISSION_PROTOCOLS]] if working on task management
3. Review relevant galaxy files for project-specific context
4. Ask Andrea for clarification on anything unclear
